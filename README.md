# 🎮 Evaluation of Big Packet Protocol Packet Wash for Game Streaming

This repository contains resources to evaluate the Packet Wash technique for scalable video streaming, especially in gaming scenarios.
Requirements

To use this repository, please ensure the following dependencies are installed:
### 1. 🧩 JSVM (H264 Reference Software)

Scalable H.264 reference software provided by Fraunhofer HHI.

    Download version 9_19_15 from the official JVET Git repository:
    🔗 https://vcgit.hhi.fraunhofer.de/jvet/jsvm

### 2. 🎥 FFmpeg

FFmpeg is required for video processing and visual quality assessments.

    Download FFmpeg from:
    🔗 https://ffmpeg.org/download.html

Ensure your FFmpeg build includes the following filters:

    PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)

    SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)

    VMAF (Video Multi-Method Assessment Fusion)

Alternatively, you can use the standalone VMAF tool from Netflix:

### 3. 🧪 Packet Wash Implementation

This project uses the Packet Wash implementation developed by Stuart Clayman.

## 🔧 Additional Utilities

If you need to downscale the video for any reason, you can may want to use `./DownConvertStatic` provided in JSVM, but this is only one way of doing it.

    ./DownConvertStatic [width] [height] [location]/[file_original].yuv [width] [height] [location]/[file_downsize].yuv

If you want to lower the framerate which might be needed, you can use ffmpeg as follows:

    ffmpeg -s [width]x[height] -pix_fmt yuv420p -framerate 60 -i [location]/[file_high_fps].yuv -vf "select='not(mod(n\,2))'" -fps_mode passthrough -f rawvideo [location]/[file_low_fps].yuv

## Folder Overview

- 📁 [`confs`](./confs): Contains configuration files used for Scalable Video Coding (SVC).
- 📁 [`results`](./results): Includes the results before and after applying the Packet Wash technique.
